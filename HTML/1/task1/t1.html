				Two households, both alike in dignity,
				<br>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
				<br>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
				<br>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
				<br>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
				<br>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
				<br>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
				<br>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
				<br>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
				<br>And the continuance of their parents' rage,
				<br>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
				<br>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
				<br>The which if you with patient ears attend,
				<br>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
